In Astroworld, Superman embarked[v] on a cosmic[n] adventure. 
He wandered[v] through the iridescent[a] streets, guided by whispers of Travis Scott. 
Entering a celestial[a] store, he found[v] Travis amidst a throng of admirers.
It was surreal[a], the way time seemed to warp around them. Travis's presence was magnetic[a], 
drawing Clark into a world of pulsating[a] beats and otherworldly[a] rhythms. As Travis spoke, 
Superman felt[v] a sense of awe wash over him. It was more than just a meeting; it was a journey 
into the heart of Astroworld's magic. And in that moment, Superman knew he was home.
